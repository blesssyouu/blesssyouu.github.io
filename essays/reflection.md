## Throw your expectations out the window
  Going into this Spring 2023 semester I knew my classes were going to be hard but I was mostly worried about ICS 314. Not because it's an extremely difficult class but because I wasn't the most experienced programmer going into this class and knew I'd struggle from the start. Getting used to the style of the class was a big transition in itself having to prepare for the WODs and constant assignments due every week but once I got into the rhythm of things everything was basically smooth sailing. 
  
## Functional Programming
  Functional programming is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create a maintainable program. This method takes advantage of using functions as variables, arguments and return values to create a clean, well organized code that is easy to follow along with. With the rise of machine learning in the past few years, functional programming has become a lot more popular. I could definitely see myself using this method for future projects. 
  
## Open Source Software Developmentoddie
  OPen source software is usually a free software product where programmers can access other programmer's code.
