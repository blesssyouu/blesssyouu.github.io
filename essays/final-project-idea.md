## Overview
Problem: Finding microwaves, water fountains, bottle refill stations, vending machines, etc. 
Solution: Our app will allow users to input buildings around them and it will tell them the nearest they have access to. 

## Mockup
* Landing/home page
* Login 
* Register
* Map page
* User profile
* Admin page
* Editing page

## Use Case Ideas
* User creates a new profile and inputs their information
* User logins 
* View map and filter for whichever amenities the user wants to see
* Users can add new and different amenities 
* If the user’s student information changes, they can edit and update their profile
* At the admin level, the user can view all accounts and manage them

## Beyond Basics
* Interactive map with pin location/add amenity features.
* Can add real time updates to show if out of order with timestamp and update to show if itʻs working again
* User can indicate their favorite amenities
* Can add what specific vending machine has what snacks/drinks
* Admin validates all updates pushed by users before they are sent to all accounts
