## As a Newbie

Going into this I had absolutely no background on Javvascript so I had no idea what to expect. After going through the CodeCamp, Javascript is a lot easier than I thought it would be. Even though doing about 140 exercises wasnʻt the most motivating to learn the language it was super helpful and gratifying at the end of both modules. Comparing it to the other languages I was already familiar with, Javascript is a lot more efficient. An example of this is declaring variables with javascript. Instead of having to declare them at the beginning of your code; depending on what's being fed into it, the types changes automatically. 

## Crossfit?

Iʻm still getting used to the structure of this class and getting into the flow of things but so far the practice WODs are extremely useful. It gives a chance to experienceit without counting against us. I will say that it seems to be pretty efficient but also pretty stressful at the same time given how many things we have to submit on a weekly basis. I'm hoping that this style will work for me and I'm able to pass the class and retain a lot of the information covered. I do think it's extremely clever taking WODs from crossfit and altering it so the class can take advantage of the concept with coding.
